.SH NAME
FcFontationsQueryAll \- compute all patterns from font file (and index)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <fontconfig.h>
#include <fcfontations.h>
.sp
unsigned int FcFontationsQueryAll (const FcChar8 *\fIfile\fB, int \fIid\fB, FcBlanks *\fIblanks\fB, int *\fIcount\fB, FcFontSet *\fIset\fB);
.fi\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
UNSTABLE feature. Constructs patterns found in 'file'. Currently pattern is incomplete
compared to FcFreeTypeQueryAll() and may deviate from what FreeType indexing produces.
Not supported yet, but will follow: If id is -1, then all patterns found
in 'file' are added to 'set'.
Otherwise, this function works exactly like FcFreeTypeQueryAll()/FcFreeTypeQuery().
The number of faces in 'file' is returned in 'count'.
The number of patterns added to 'set' is returned.
FcBlanks is deprecated, \fIblanks\fR is ignored and
accepted only for compatibility with older code.
