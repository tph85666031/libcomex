@PURPOSE@       compute all patterns from font file (and index)
@DESC@
UNSTABLE feature. Constructs patterns found in 'file'. Currently pattern is incomplete
compared to FcFreeTypeQueryAll() and may deviate from what FreeType indexing produces.
Not supported yet, but will follow: If id is -1, then all patterns found
in 'file' are added to 'set'.
Otherwise, this function works exactly like FcFreeTypeQueryAll()/FcFreeTypeQuery().
The number of faces in 'file' is returned in 'count'.
The number of patterns added to 'set' is returned.
FcBlanks is deprecated, <parameter>blanks</parameter> is ignored and
accepted only for compatibility with older code.
